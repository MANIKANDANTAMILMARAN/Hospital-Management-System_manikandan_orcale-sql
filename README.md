üè• Hospital Management System (HMS) Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing various aspects of hospital operations to derive actionable insights that can enhance patient care, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall efficiency. Leveraging Power BI, the project aims to visualize and interpret data effectively, facilitating informed decision-making.

üîë Key Features of the Project

Patient Admission and Discharge Analysis:

 * Evaluation of patient admission trends over time.
 * Analysis of average length of stay and discharge patterns.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used

 * Oracle SQL: For creating and managing relational databases, writing complex queries, and performing data manipulation.
 * Oracle SQL Developer: An integrated development environment for working with Oracle databases.

‚úÖ Conclusion

The Hospital Management System (HMS) project, developed exclusively using SQL, effectively demonstrates the capabilities of structured query language in managing complex healthcare data. By designing a robust relational database schema, the system efficiently handles critical hospital operations such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, billing, and medical record management. The use of SQL ensures data integrity, facilitates swift data retrieval, and supports comprehensive reporting, thereby enhancing decision-making processes within the hospital setting. This project underscores the pivotal role of SQL in developing scalable and secure healthcare management solutions, laying a strong foundation for future enhancements and integrations.
